                <p>Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Son of a gun. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue.</p>

                <p>You have to make these big decisions. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around.</p>

                <p>If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Let's have a little bit of fun today. In your world you have total and absolute power. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that.</p>

                <p>Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. A beautiful little sunset. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner.</p>
