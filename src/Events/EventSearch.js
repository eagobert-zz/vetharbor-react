                <p>This is truly an almighty mountain. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Only eight colors that you need. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. If you hypnotize it, it will go away.</p>

                <p>Just make a decision and let it go. You're meant to have fun in life. Everybody needs a friend. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness.</p>

                <p>In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. We have a fantastic little sky! We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.</p>

                <p>As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. At home you have unlimited time. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here.</p>
